  "clean_text": "Wild pigs running away from the fields after listening to the songs of Honey Singh's Dehradun @ magazine: The farmers of Nainital found a very unique solution when they could not get rid of wild pigs and other animals in their fields even after all the trouble. Now their help is playing the songs of Honey Singh's Singh, due to which not only wild pigs but other animals are also running away from their fields. This trick has given a lot of relief to the farmers. There was so much terror of wild pigs that the state government had to order them to be killed. The farmer Bishan Jantwal of Dhari village in Nainital, who had successfully used this solution, had heard from his elders that the wild TRs avoid hitting where humans live. I thought that music would lead to the illusion that there are humans around and it worked. After this, the people of other villages also adopted this idea.",
